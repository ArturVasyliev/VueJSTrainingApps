Q: Why do we need a proper (development) web server?
A: To server pages with http/https and not as files (simulate realistic circumstances). Some JS features may work only with pages served using http/https.

Q: Why do we need better developer experience?
A: 1) Now when we change something we need to reload the page.
   2) IDE auto-completion is highly limited. No typos warnings.
   3) We only work in one script file and one html that can be very large.

Vue CLI improves development of Vue apps. It requires Node.js installed.
Then run 'npm install -g @vue/cli' to install Vue CLI.
Then cd to the project folder and run 'vue create app-name'.
After choosing configurations, the default project will be created. The configs I used:
1) Preset => Manually select features
2) Features => Choose Vue version, Babel, Linter/Formatter
3) Vue version => 3.x
4) Pick a linter => ESLint with error prevention only
5) Lint features => Lint on save
6) Place for configs (Babel, ESLint etc.) => In dedicated config files
7) Save as a preset => n

After the project is created run 'cd first-app-with-vue-cli' and 'npm run serve' to run the server and open the page.
