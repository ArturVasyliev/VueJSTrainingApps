Q: Why do we need a proper (development) web server?
A: To server pages with http/https and not as files (simulate realistic circumstances). Some JS features may work only with pages served using http/https.

Q: Why do we need better developer experience?
A: 1) Now when we change something we need to reload the page.
   2) IDE auto-completion is highly limited. No typos warnings.
   3) We only work in one script file and one html that can be very large.
